            <h2>What is Good Health?</h2>
            <p>Good health is a state of physical, mental, and social well-being in which an individual is free from illness or injury. It goes beyond just the absence of disease, involving overall wellness and the ability to manage stress, maintain relationships, and lead a fulfilling life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Parameters of Good Health</h2>
            <h3>1. Physical Activity</h3>
            <p>Regular physical activity strengthens the heart, muscles, and bones, helps manage weight, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Balanced Diet</h3>
            <p>A balanced diet provides essential nutrients your body needs to function effectively. This includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid excessive sugar, salt, and saturated fats.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Mental Health</h3>
            <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health. It involves managing stress, maintaining a positive outlook, and seeking help when needed. Practices like meditation, regular sleep, and social connections can improve mental well-being.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Hydration</h3>
            <p>Water is essential for maintaining the body's temperature, removing waste, and lubricating joints. It's recommended to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, though individual needs may vary based on activity level and environment.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Sleep</h3>
            <p>Quality sleep is vital for physical and mental health. Adults should aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Good sleep hygiene, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule and creating a restful environment, is important for restful sleep.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Regular Check-ups</h3>
            <p>Regular health check-ups can help detect and prevent potential health issues early. Routine screenings and consultations with healthcare providers are essential for maintaining good health.</p>
